            <b>Being happy isn't just about having a good time, it's about finding joy in the little things and looking forward to each day with anticipation. <br>
                It starts with taking care of yourself physically, mentally and emotionally - diet, exercise, mental health breaks, <br>
                mindfulness and self-care are all important for maintaining a cheerful outlook. Additionally,<br>
                surrounding yourself with positive people who support you and make you laugh can help foster healthy emotions;<br>
                it's also wise to limit exposure to those who exhaust your emotional energy. Finally, focus on what's going right in your life - <br>
                appreciate the moments that bring true happiness and be kind to yourself if any plans don't go as expected.<br> 
                At the end of the day remember that contentment is key: life will always have its ups and downs but by nurturing a sense of gratitude for life's joys you'll keep being happy!</b>
